## The Fascination with the Dreamcast

The Dreamcast has always been a fascinating console. First, because it was a massive commercial failure, and understanding what led to this downfall is insightful. Second, because the console itself was revolutionary for its time, with an arcade-style positioning that set it apart from other consoles of its generation. Third, because it marks a significant turning point in Sega's decline and a noteworthy event in the history of video games. As for my own story with the Dreamcast, it began in Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong, in 2016, when I found a yellowed Dreamcast at the bottom of a chest, just waiting to be plugged in. The rest of the story follows below!

## Impatience and Rookie Mistakes

After purchasing the Dreamcast for a modest 10 HKD, I couldn't wait and plugged it in immediately in my damp, moldy room in North Point. This led to a soft burning smell coming from the console... Indeed, in my haste, I hadn't realized that the Dreamcast was Japanese and that I had put 220V into a console that only accepted 110V. Three months later, I returned to France with this corpse, like Dr. Jean-François Martinot hoping to one day resurrect his wife with the advances of science.


## Six Years Later, Opening the Freezer Again

Lost for six years in a cabinet filled with clutter, I stumbled upon the Dreamcast again during a summer vacation at my parents' house. It felt like rediscovering an old, unfinished project. After opening up the machine, I realized that the power supply board’s main task was simply to output 3.3V, 5V, and 12V. At that moment, hope rekindled, and I figured someone must have found a solution. I came across [Dream PSU](https://www.dreammods.net/psu.html) which appeared to be the jolt of electricity to revive my dead console. After ordering and installing it—surprise! It booted up. This marked the beginning of my fascination with Dreamcast modding.

## Optical drive : I would like a SD card reader instead

Uncertain about the state of my optical drive, I decided to explore another modding project that replaces the optical drive with an SD card reader. This project is called [GDemu](https://gdemu.wordpress.com/installation/gdemu-installation/).  and you can find the product on AliExpress through this affiliate link: [Retroscaler - GDemu](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005005772235125.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.319.6a5b5e5bA9Yqwn&gatewayAdapt=glo2fra). Installation is straightforward—just remove the optical drive and replace it with the GDemu. The GDemu is powered directly by the Dreamcast, so there’s no need to worry about additional power sources. Just connect it to the Dreamcast and configure it; it boots like a regular game.

## A New Shell : Going All-In with Atomic Purple

Finally, I decided to swap the old yellowed Dreamcast's shell with a transparent purple plastic case. This case reminded me of my old Atomic Purple Game Boy, and I must say I always feel a nostalgic pull whenever I see that color. I bought this case from AliExpress (affiliate link): [Bitfunx - Dreamcast Case](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005005764315288.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.264.6a5b5e5bA9Yqwn&gatewayAdapt=glo2fra). The case change is relatively simple, and the result looks stunning. I'm still undecided on which Dreamcast logo to apply between blue and red, haha. I think again about where i found the dreamcast and how it looks like now, as a brand new console.

After that, I also added an SD extension to the GDemu to easily switch SD cards without opening the Dreamcast: [SD Gdemu Extension](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005007532461191.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.279.6a5b5e5bA9Yqwn&gatewayAdapt=glo2fra). The color matches well with the purple case.

The final look is amazing.

## Dreamcast Real-Time Clock: Never Asking to Set the Time Again

![Dreamcast Port manette](/images/portmanette.jpg)

To finish, I decided to add a real-time clock (RTC) to my Dreamcast to avoid having to set the time every time I start it up. The modification is quite simple. It involves desoldering the battery from the controller port. I chose to replace it with a slot for a rechargeable CR2032 battery (just in case the new battery fails again).

## Conclusion

It was a long journey, but reviving and customizing this Dreamcast has been deeply rewarding, blending nostalgia with modern functionality and giving new life to an iconic console.
